## What is Morse Code? Who developed Morse Code?

According to the explanation in Wikipedia, it is a method used int telecommunication. It encodes text by serialized in two durations and spaces. Nowadays, the table that we are familiar with is called International Morse Code, and it is not originated one. Here is the encoding rule. The two durations are dot and dash. Dot is one unit, and dash is three unit. The space between each symbol is called space, and it is one empty unit. The space between each letter is three empty unit. The space between each words is seven empty unit. This method can be transmited by electronic pluse or other physical representation like sound or light.

Morse Code was first developed by Samuel F.B. Morse in 1837 when he and his friends needed a method for transmitting natural language in their developed electrical telegraph system. Initial version of morse code only represents number, and in 1840, the system was extended to letters and special characters by Alfred Vail. He accorded to the frequency of usage of letter in English text to design numbers of unit for a letter encoding inversely. Also, comparing original morse code that represented in patterns of dot and space, Alfred's version utilized combination of dot and dash. It is apparently clear and easy to use rather than old one, so it was soon accepted widely in Europe. Then, in 1851, the variant, International Morse Code, which we are familiar with and which we use nowadays, were devised by a conferenced of European nation.

Even though morse code played an important role in WWI, WWII, and the past one century, it was replaced with other advanced method in the end of 21 century in military services of some country, like US and France.
